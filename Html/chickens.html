      <strong>The sun</strong> is the star at the center of the Solar System. It
      is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence
      by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as
      visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important
      source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million
      kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about
      330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total
      mass of the Solar System.[20]

    <h1>Quartiers</h1>
    <p>
      Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the
      rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier
      elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.
