    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
      building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
      objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
      structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
      quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
      using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt; input &gt;directly introduce c
      surround and provide information about document text and may include other
      tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them
      to interpret the content of the page.

    <h2 id="section-css">CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
      HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of
      presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
      separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
      improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
      formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
      present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
      methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
      or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
      rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
      device.
